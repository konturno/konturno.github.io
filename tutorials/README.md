## Concept

Learning how to program is an educational process.

As with most educational processes, the task is to open up your mind to new ways of thinking.

The processes, however, may take a long time, have many false directions and much effort may end up not being that useful.
-->

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To create a just-in-time free, open source learning system, where you learn just enough to design some useful things.

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

To get more things designed better, faster and cheaper
