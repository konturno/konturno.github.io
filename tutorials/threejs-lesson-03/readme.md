## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

It takes more than boxes and cylinders to make a design
### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To help you create arbitrary shapes with specific dimensions


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

Designers create cool apps so normal peeps have access to unique well designed products

## Things to Try

### Drawing and Editing

* Edit the dimensions of the existing objects
* Edit the position and rotation of the existing objects
* Add some new vertices to the existing objects
* Add a new object
	* reposition and rotate the new object



## Issues / Things to note

### JavaScript Console
* Find where thickness is set and change it?
	* Can you see its value using the JavaScript console ( F12 )?
* Can you find out what JavaScript knows about the last shape you made?
	* Type 'shape' in the console and then click on the arrows

## Features

* Use sliders to scale and position objects
* Rotate, Zoom and Pan
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan
