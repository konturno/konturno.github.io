###### _Three.js Lesson 1 - Code Edit View_ /  [Edit full screen]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-html/templates/code-edit-view/code-edit-view-r2.html#http://jaanga.github.io/tutorials/threejs-lesson-01/threejs-lesson-01.html )


## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

If you are a an engineer or designer, the first thing you want to do is to create or edit new things. 

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To get you drawing and editing objects in 3D ASAP


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->


## Things to Try

### 'Code Edit View' Editor (the two windows just above)

* Change the views to horizontal and then back to vertical
* Use the slider bar to shrink and expand the views
	* Click 'Update View' to center the drawing
* Edit the code and then click 'Update View' to see the results of your edits
	* See 'Drawing and Editing' just below for some ideas
* Click the 'Edit full screen' link to get a big picture
	* Watch out: you will lose your edits (until we figure out how to keep them)
* When things get really messed up, reload the page
* If you like what you have done, click the 'Save to File' button
	* Also use this button if you prefer to download the file and work with your own editor.


### Drawing and Editing
* Copy and paste the code (in the code view on the right) for one of the boxes and use the code to add a new box in a new position
* Add more boxes in more places, in more sizes with varying rotation
* Add your name to the title of the lesson
	* Change the text size to 24 point text
* Make the sizes of the grid and axis indicator much larger and different from each other
* Move the initial camera position so that you look almost straight down or from the side

A bit harder - do these only if you have the time

* Can you add three blocks that are co-planar so that there is a hole in the middle that looks like a door?
* Using four blocks can you make a wall with a window?


## Features

* Rotate, Zoom and Pan
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan

## Issues / Things to note

* These lessons are built and test on the Google Chrome browse. They may/will have issues on other browsers
	* Let us know if you really must use another browser and we will try to help 
* Three.js inserts objects using the center point of the object - not using a corner as most CAD apps do
* Three.js uses traditional computer graphics XYZ - the Z comes out of the screen and the Y points up
* Any HTML file you download, can be clicked on to view in your browser
