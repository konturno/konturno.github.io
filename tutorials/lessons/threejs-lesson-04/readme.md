## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

Designs are built with parts, The parts must fit together. This is not always easy to do.
The frint and back should have the same width and the sides equal depth. A change of thickness changes all the parts


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To help you create [parametric components]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_design )


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

Designers create cool apps so normal peeps have access to unique well designed products

## Things to Try

### Drawing and Editing

* Edit the default dimensions of the existing objects
* Edit the default position of the existing objects
* Add some new parametric vertices to the existing objects
* Add a new object to be the 'top'
	* reposition the new object
* There are a number of design errors with the current components. Can you fix any of them? Not easy.


## Issues / Things to note

### JavaScript Console

* Can you see what's inside the front, back and bottom variables?
* Absolutely everything is inside: windows
* Three.js is in: THREE, but we mostly look at scene and scene.children
	* Type a . after a variable to see what it contains


## Features

* Use sliders to scale and position objects
* Rotate, Zoom and Pan
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan
