<details open >

<summary>Concept</summary>

* List, select, open and view [OBJ files]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file ) in 3D
* Generate contour points and lines
* Export contour line vertices to [CSV files]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values )

### Features

_In order of appearance on the menu_

- Browse, open and view OBJ files in 3D
	- Open OBJ files using file dialog box
	- Browse libraries of pre-selected OBJ files on the web
	- Geometry is automatically scaled, centered and zoomed
	- Combine multiple geometries into a single Three.js mesh
	- A variety of geometries created by algorithm are available for testing
- Generate contour points
	- Choose one to many
	- Select elevation of a single contour line
- Generate contour lines
	- Menu displays a number of stats
	- Toggle view of mesh, contours and points
- Export vertices to CSV files
	- Export as strings of vertices
	- XYZ coordinates plus a line index
- Settings
	- Update a variety of scene display settings
	- Rotate around XYZ
	- Select material
	- Update opacity
	- Toggle edges, box helper and wireframe

### Mission

- To be able to create contours for any OBJ file
- To be able to generate contours for any 3D file (STL etc ) or parametric

### Vision

- Augment 3D so as to supply it with even greater dimensionality

### Versions


[OBJ to CSV v-pw0.01.00 ](v-pw-0-01/obj-to-csv-pw.html)

* Built on Paul West's point to line sequencing algorithm
* Frequently creates lines with only a few vertices

***

Both Paul West's and Theo Armour's algorithms for sequencing point into polylines have issues. We will continue to work on both - in separate forks: v-pw and v-ta

Currently the Paul West algorithm produces the better results and is set as the default version.

Because of the two algorithms the generation of contour points and contour lines is split into two separate operations. Once one of the algorithms begins to operate fully as desired the operations may be recombined.

***

[OBJ to CSV 0.11.00 ](v-0-11/obj-to-csv.html)

* Built on Paul West's point to line sequencing algorithm

[OBJ to CSV 0.10.00 ](v-0-10/obj-to-csv.html)

* Built on Theo Armour's point to line sequencing algorithm
* Generates on a single polyline per contour level
* Fails to complete if a polyline is not closed

[OBJ to CSV 0.09.00 ](v-0-09/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-23

* Adds Geometry simplify
* Files an menu items moved around
* Object rotation and mesh material settings get more features


[OBJ to CSV 0.08.00 ](v-0-08/obj-to-csv.html)

[OBJ to CSV 0.07.00 ](v-0-07/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-19

- Getting closer
- Still some very short segments showing up
* Need to work on standardizing all the normals and connecting adjoing segments


[OBJ to CSV 0.06.05 ](v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-16

- Code cleanup and rejig menu a bit

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.04 ](v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html)

- Start the contouring process from the top - More funner that way
- Add 'join adjacent segments' button - Not fully functioning yet

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.03 ](v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html)

- Add 'Remove short segments' button - Button must be pushed in order to intiate a second pass on the data - Does better job of finding and deleting - Provides report on how many segments deleted
- Add contour line labels checkbox toggle - Will help with identifying and reporting contours with issues
- Add contours are drawn in real-time as they are being calculated - Makes for a more attractive user experience

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.02 ](v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-12

- Deletes segments of three vertices or less that are all very close together
- Add if last vertex is close to first vertex then close the polygon
- Update the statistics display

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.01 ](v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-11

- Looking OK
- Too many new things to list

[OBJ to CSV 0.05.00 ](v-0-05/obj-to-csv.html)

- Mostly broken
- Gets Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

[OBJ to CSV 0.04.02 ](v-0-04/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-07

- Add link to Render CSV file
- When ask for 72 contour levels you now get 72 contour levels (but each contour may have multiple lines)
- Export CSV segments dropped

[OBJ to CSV 0.04.00 ](v-0-04/obj-to-csv.html)

2019-12-06

- Exported contours beginning to look good

[OBJ to CSV 0.03 ](v-0-03/obj-to-csv-01.html)

- Based on Theo Armour's first point to line sequencing algorithm
- Keep hacking at better contours

[OBJ to CSV 0.02 ](v-0-02/get-contours-from-objects.html)

- Keep hacking at better contours

[OBJ to CSV 0.01 ](v-0-01/get-contours-from-objects.html)

- Adds export to segments
- Mesh material settings
- Add contour points toggles

[OBJ to CSV 0.00 ](v-0-00/get-contours-from-objects.html)

- Complete remake of group-points-of-intersection
- Code split up into modules

#### [group-points-of-intersection read me](https://jaanga.github.io/demo/doug-d/obj-to-csv/group-points-of-intersection/readme.html)

- Covers the details and links to five earlier releases
- Includes the file from Paul West that that inspired

It looks like some of my "improvements"  to the code by Paul West are the cause of the addition of the many small segments. Must rejig my code.
