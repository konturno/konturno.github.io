How long is a "piece of string"?

Imagine a 3D sculpture and a ball of string. Take the string and wrap it round and round the sculpture. As you are wrapping the string you need to hold the string in place. So you stick a pin through the string and into the sculpture. Now, let us say you have just 100,000 pins.

How long is the piece of string?

We will find out tomorrow. In the meantime you can see the string above.
